# Exploration for the Internal Resonance under Thermal Noise
The idea of this exploration is to see whether one can achieve Internal Resonance (IR), and obtain the benefits of IR that we have seen (*e.g.* frequency stabilization, coherent time) in such case. 

## Baseline study: Damped driven oscillator (w/o noise)
This is a
